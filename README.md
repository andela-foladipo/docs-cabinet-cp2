## UPDATE2: The Frontend is coming...
We've now implemented all the endpoints required for this app. What we're
 working on now is a user interface that you'll love and find as easy to
 use as possible...

## UPDATE: The Backend is coming...
We are making a lot of progress in setting up the backend of this project. So,
we should soon have something for you to play with and hack. Stay tuned!
